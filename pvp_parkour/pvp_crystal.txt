(buffs: strength II, speed II)
(debuffs: slowfalling, slowness IV, weakness)
(other: turtlemaster)

player is immune to melee damage and knockback during fire damage and pearl damage
popping totem clears previous potion effects
arrow priority starts from hotbar, but in inventory it is prioritized left to right, top to bottom
player having weakness effect cannot break crystal with hand or with some other items
    - strength potion can counter it
    - crystal can be broken with sword
while in air its better to hold on your hotbar totem while crystal pvp
    - avoids getting double tapped
jumping while opponent is trying to hit crystal can save you a totem
